# Burgers   

## Description 
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user has an internet connection they should be able to use the application.  

## Usage
This was a homework assignement. 

## Credit
I  create this project from the outline given to me by my Triology Education Services instructor. I  also took code from my old homework and in class activities. I had help from my tutor Isabel Arcones.

## Contributing 
I was the only person contributing to this project, but I also had help from my tutor and classmates. 

## Challenges
One of my major challenges was that I had never used handlebars until my tutory had walked me through it. I'm still pretty shacky but with more practice I'll get better. This was also my first time using the MVC design pattern which made the set up take longer then I thought it would. In the end it made it easier to debug my code. It took me awhile to deploy my application with Heroku. I kept on recieving an error message when I would deplkoy my application. The issue was that I needed to update my server, database, username and password. I kept the information if someone would want to run the application locally.
